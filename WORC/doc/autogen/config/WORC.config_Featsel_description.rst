Variance                 If True, exclude features which have a variance < 0.01. Based on ` sklearn"s VarianceThreshold <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.VarianceThreshold.html/>`_.                                                                   
GroupwiseSearch          Randomly select which feature groups to use. Parameters determined by the SelectFeatGroup config part, see below.                                                                                                                                                         
SelectFromModel          Percentage of times features are selected by first training a LASSO model. The alpha for the LASSO model is randomly generated. See also `sklearn"s SelectFromModel <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html/>`_.
UsePCA                   Percentage of times Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to select features.                                                                                                                                                                                        
PCAType                  Method to select number of components using PCA: Either the number of components that explains 95% of the variance, or use a fixed number of components.95variance                                                                                                        
StatisticalTestUse       Percentage of times a statistical test is used to select features.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
StatisticalTestMetric    Define the type of statistical test to be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
StatisticalTestThreshold Specify a threshold for the p-value threshold used in the statistical test to select features. The first element defines the lower boundary, the other the upper boundary. Random sampling will occur between the boundaries.                                             
ReliefUse                Percentage of times Relief is used to select features.
