# Welcome to the tutorial of WORC: a Workflow for Optimal Radiomics
# Classification! It will provide you with basis knowledge and practical
# skills on how to run the WORC. For advanced topics and WORCflows, please see
# the other notebooks provided with this tutorial. For installation details,
# see the ReadMe.md provided with this tutorial.

# This tutorial interacts with WORC through SimpleWORC and is especially
# suitable for first time usage.

    # Input
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The minimal inputs to WORC are:
    #   - Images
    #   - Segmentations
    #   - Labels
    #
    # In SimpleWORC, we assume you have a folder "datadir", in which there is a
    # folder for each patient, where in each folder there is a image.nii.gz and a mask.nii.gz:
    #           Datadir
    #               Patient_001
    #                   image.nii.gz
    #                   mask.nii.gz
    #               Patient_002
    #                   image.nii.gz
    #                   mask.nii.gz
    #               ...
    #
    #
    # You can skip this part if you use your own data.
    # In the example, We will use open source data from the online XNAT platform
    # at https://xnat.bmia.nl/data/archive/projects/stwstrategyhn1. This dataset
    # consists of CT scans of patients with Head and Neck tumors. We will download
    # a subset of 20 patients in this folder. You can change this settings if you
    # like

    nsubjects = 20  # use "all" to download all patients
    # NOTE: already downloaded for classification, so simply set the data path

    # Analysis of results
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # There are two main outputs: the features for each patient/object, and the overall
    # performance. These are stored as .hdf5 and .json files, respectively. By
    # default, they are saved in the so-called "fastr output mount", in a subfolder
    # named after your experiment name.

    # Read the overall peformance
    experiment_folder = os.path.join(outputfolder, 'WORC_' + experiment_name)
    performance_file = os.path.join(experiment_folder, 'performance_all_0.json')
    if not os.path.exists(performance_file):
        raise ValueError('No performance file found: your network has failed.')

    with open(performance_file, 'r') as fp:
        performance = json.load(fp)

    # Print the output performance
    print("\n Performance:")
    stats = performance['Statistics']
    for k, v in stats.items():
        print(f"\t {k} {v}.")

    # NOTE: the performance is probably horrible, which is expected as we ran
    # the experiment on coarse settings. These settings are recommended to only
    # use for testing: see also below.

    # Tips and Tricks
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # For tips and tricks on running a full experiment instead of this simple
    # example, adding more evaluation options, debuggin a crashed network etcetera,
    # please go to https://worc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/static/user_manual.html

    # Some things we would advice to always do:
    #   - Run actual experiments on the full settings (coarse=False):
    #       coarse = False
    #       experiment.binary_classification(coarse=coarse)
    #   Note: this will result in more computation time. We therefore recommmend
    #   to run this script on either a cluster or high performance PC. If so,
    #   you may change the execution to use multiple cores to speed up computation
    #   just before before experiment.execute():
    #       experiment.set_multicore_execution()
    #
    #   - Add extensive evaluation: experiment.add_evaluation() before experiment.execute():
    #       experiment.add_evaluation()
