3.3.5 - 2020-10-21
------------------

Fixed
~~~~~
- Some function cleaning: removing redundant parts / variables.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Part of developper documentation for addinf methods to hyperoptimization.
- Default config: SelectFromModel incorporated, so now also use
  that in feature selection step.

- Documentation updates.
- SelectFromModel expanded and properly integrated in workflow.
- AdaBoost as classifier and regressor.
- XGDBoost as classifier and regressor.

~~~~~
- Bugfixes in some error messages.
- If a classifier cannot give a score, use the prediction instead.
- Bugfix in bootstrapping.
- Bugfix: use f1-weighted score in SimpleWORC binary classification.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- There are no longer ''patient_features'' in PREDICT: these are extracted
  from the DICOM tags and are thus now called ''dicom_features.
- As bootstrapping is now more efficient, increase default to 1000 iterations.

Added
~~~~~~~

------------------

Fixed
~~~~~
- In the RobustStandardScaler, if less than two values for a feature are left,
  use the original set inset of the ``robust'' reduced set.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- By default, semantic features are skipped in scaling, as the robust scaler
  cannot deal well with categorical variables.
- Wrapped scalers in single WORC scaler object to allow above for all scalers.

Added
~~~~~~~

Fixed
~~~~~
- Bug in fit and score when using scaling: was incorrectly parsed as string
  and always set to None.
- Catch exception in ADASYN sampling.
- Typo in configuration documentation.

Added
~~~~~~~
- New type of scaler (robust z-scoring)
- Resampling of image and mask in preprocessing (preprocessing and segmentix
  nodes)

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Newly added scaler is now also the default to use, instead of the search
  over the older included scalers.
- Evaluation of estimator is now separate from training it.

3.3.1 - 2020-07-31
------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Updated to using tikzplotlib for conversion of figures to LaTeX instead
  of deprecated matplotlib2tikz.
- Output of evaluation pipeline now in separate subfolder.
- KNNImputer now also in sklearn, missingpy deprecated, so switched to
  sklearn KNNImputer.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Bug in fixandscore when using resampling.


3.3.0 - 2020-07-28

Added
~~~~~~~
- Graphviz vizualization of network is now nicely grouped.
- Properly integrated ObjectSampler: various resampling options now available.
- Verbose option to fit and score tool
- Validator for PyRadiomics output.
- FAQ version to documentation

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Upgraded to new versions of sklearn (0.23.1) and imbalanced learn (0.7.0)
- Some defaults, based on computation time.
- Do not skip workflow if feature selection selects zero features,
  but disable the feature selection.
- Do not skip workflow if resampling is unsuccesfull,
  but disable the resampling.
- Default scaling is now not only Z-score, but also MinMax and Robust

  we use all kinds of estimators.
- L1 penalty does not work with new standard LR solver. Removed L1 penalty.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Bug when using both elastix and segmentix.
- Bug when using elastix in train-test workflow.
- IMPORTANT: Previously, all methods except the machine learning where fit on
  both the training and validation set together in fitandscore. This led
  to overfitting on the validation set. Now, these are properly split.
- Bugfix in Evaluate standalone for decompositon tool.
- Applied imputation in decomposition if NaNs are detected.
- In the facade ConfigBuilder, an error is raised when incorrect
  overrides are given.
- Bugfix in statistical feature test plotting.
- Bugfix in Evaluate when using ComBat
- Bugfix in feature converter of PyRadiomics when using 2D images.
- Catch Graphviz error.
- Bug in ICC.


3.2.2 - 2020-07-14
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- In classify node, when using temporary saves, start from where
  the process previously stopped instead of from the beginning.
- Imputation to ComBat.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Imputation is now the first step in the workflows. More logical as
  scaler and variance threshold can crash on missing values.
- In config, preprocessing fields are now actually called preprocessing and
  not normalize.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Preflightcheck now also compatible with BasicWORC.
- Bugfix in ComBat when not using mod variable and skipping patients.
- Bug in PyRadiomics feature converter: can now handle 2D images.
- ReliefSampleSize parameter is now a uniform distribution, which it should be.
- Gabor features now actually used in model instead of only computing them.


3.2.1 - 2020-07-02
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Major documentation update.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- PyRadiomics setup not dependent on pre-install of numpy anymore, so altered
  travis, yml, setup, and documentation.
- PREDICT updated, change dependencies.
- Defaults are now a bit different: see argumentation in the documentation.
  Main thing is that PyRadiomics and PREDICT both compute certain features,
  so it's redundant to use both. Additionally, the wavelet features
  from PyRadiomics add +1000 features, which did not seem to help in many
  experiments while majorly slowing down the computation.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Catch error when PCA does not converge in fit and score function.

3.2.0 - 2020-06-26
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Labelprocessing can now also handle having patient ID in the feature files.
  Was required for ComBat.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Output of plot_SVM function is better ordered.
- Several defaults, as we now have PyRadiomics fully embedded, resulting in
  a large increase in features.
- No more overrides for the full config, as the default now is the full config.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Cardinality of decomposition tool was incorrect.
- ComBat integration in WORC network now works properly.
- Documentation didn't build due to C-extension dependencies of PyRadiomics,
  and thus therefore also PREDICT. Fixed in setup.py and readthedocs files.
- Documentation building.
- Bugfix in segmentix test output url.
- Bugfix in SimpleWORC facade when using features.
- Warning when using Evaluation pipeline without images.


3.1.4 - 2020-05-26
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Catch error if number of segmentations supplied does not match number of
  images.
- Add support in SimpleWORC and BasicWORC for multiple segmentations per
  patient.
- Chi2 test in statistical testing.
- fastr tool to make boxplots of all features, overall and per class.
- Added this boxplot tool to the evaluate workflow.
- Option in evaluation to overfit feature scaling to test set: should only
  be used to assess differences between the training and test sets, not
  in an actual model.
- Option to delete small objects in segmentation.
- Option to within the preprocessing, use a dilated ROI.
- Otsu thresholding as mask for preprocessing.
- Memory for each fastr node is now in a dictionary of the WORC object and can
  be easily changed.
- PyRadiomics now fully embedded and configurable.
- ComBat harmonization: currently as separate tool on full dataset,
  not in cross-validation.
- Computation of ICC, and thresholding object to use ICC for feature selection.
- Added groupwise feature selection per feature extraction toolbox.
- Feature converter tool, to convert features from a toolbox to WORC compatible
  format.
- RobustScaler for feature scaling.
- Decomposition to evaluate network.
- Combat: in WORK workflow.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Resampling of objects is now after feature selection.
- Made plot_SVM function more memory efficient.
- For PCA, Relief, VarianceThreshold, and SelectFromModel feature selection,
  you can now simply supply a float to determine the percentage of times
  this method is used in the created workflows.
- Moved load_features from trainclassifier to file_io.
- Matching of PID from labels from label file to other objects is now all
  converted to lower case.
- Refactoring of WORC network building.
- Segmentix tool is cleaned up. Segmentix script is moved to processing.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Order of methods in preprocessing function of SearchCV did not correspond
  with that in fitandscore.
- Replace spaces in uri conversion of sources in SimpleWORC.
- Check whether all fitandscore jobs succeeded, otherwise throw error.
- Bug in PCA when n_components > min(n_samples, n_features)
- Random seed is now set and passed to PCA, Relief and all classifiers
  for reproducability of the results.
- Evaluate can now also accept multiple feature toolboxes.


3.1.3 - 2020-01-24
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Preprocessor slows down progress and is not always neccesary. Made it optional.
- Moved the preprocessor to the SearchCV script to do once on the training set,
  not in within the algorithm optimization.
- Ensembling during training is turned-of, as it takes to much time. Only
  used when plotting the performance.
- Debug flag includes fixed seed in cross-validation.
- Joblib now uses by default only 1 core and threading backend.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Bug in patient naming of plotting function: if ensembling was done in training,
  do not re-ensemble.


3.1.2 - 2019-12-09
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Support for Oncoradiomics RadiomiX tool
- Groupwise Search includes GLDZM, Fractal, location, NGTDM, NGLDM, wavelet,
  and rgrd features
- SimpleWORC now also accepts features instead of images and segs as input
- Preprocessor object to preprocess the features before any fitting algorithms
  are ran. Mostly to detect possible faults/errors in the data.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- On runtime, copy config.d file if it does not exist yet.

Fixed
~~~~~
- KNN imputation gave an error if >80% of the feature values were missing.
  Added preprocessing function to remove these features.

3.1.1 - 2019-11-28
------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Travis continuous integration for Windows.
- Removed RT Struct Reader, as it was buggy and not used.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- SimpleWORC now properly uses the fastr FileSystem plugin, instead
  of supplying the absolute filepaths.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Under Windows, creation of the fastr home folder if it did not exist
  did not work when using pip for installing. We now use a new feature
  of fastr to simply add the WORC folder to the fastr config
  at WORC import time.
- When debugging, override manual tempdir setting and always use default. On
  Windows, Travis gives errors if the tempdir is not in a vfs mount.
- Use shutil.move in the datadownloader, as os.rename could not overwrite files.

- Downloader for downloading example datasets.
- ReadTheDocs.yml for configuration of documentation.
- Unit test included in Travis.
- Various detectors.

Changed
~~~~~~~

------------------

Added
~~~~~~~
- Now ported to Python3.6+ (Python 2 is no longer supported!). Thereby also
  to fastr3.
- Compatibility for Windows. Some small changes in functions, as some packages
  behaviour differently under Windows. Also, adjusted sink and source paths
  to use OS file separator.
- Config is now also a sink.


Changed
~~~~~~~
- PCE and DTI node removed, as they were not open source.
- Pinfo file can now also be a csv. Txt is still supported.
- Use fastr as default for hyperparameter search parallelization instead
  of Joblib, as this is much more flexible.
- When the conffidence interval cannot be computed, just use the mean.


Fixed
~~~~~
- WORC_config.py was not correctly copied in Windows due to incorrect path separation.
